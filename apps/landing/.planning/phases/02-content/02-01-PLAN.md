<objective>
Build the Features, How It Works, and Social Proof sections from the Getmany Figma template adapted for TendHunt content, using CSS-only animations and a tabbed carousel pattern for feature showcase.

Purpose: Deliver the core conversion funnel sections that explain TendHunt's value proposition (features), user journey (how it works), and credibility (social proof) to convert landing page visitors into waitlist signups.

Output: Three complete landing page sections with responsive layouts, CSS animations, and a reusable tabbed carousel component — all ready for deployment.

Create the Features section showcasing 3 features (Contract Discovery, Vibe Scanner/Buying Signals, Buyer Intelligence) using a tabbed carousel layout adapted from the Getmany Figma template.

**FeaturesSection.astro:**
- Full-width section with bg-bg-primary background
- Container: max-w-[80rem] px-6 py-24
- Section heading: "Find contracts. Win business." with subtitle explaining AI-powered platform
- Import and use TabsCarousel component with 3 panels (one per feature)
- Each feature panel includes:
  - Feature icon/illustration component (import from illustrations/)
  - Feature title (h3, font-heading)
  - Benefit-focused description (2-3 sentences, text-text-secondary)
  - Optional: "Learn more" link (deferred to Phase 4, leave as commented placeholder)

**Feature copy (benefit-focused):**
1. **Contract Discovery** - "Search 200,000+ UK government contracts from Find a Tender and Contracts Finder. Filter by sector, value, region, and CPV codes. Never miss an opportunity."
2. **Buying Signals / Vibe Scanner** - "AI scans board minutes to surface pre-tender signals. See what's coming before the RFP drops. Create custom alerts based on your company profile."
3. **Buyer Intelligence** - "Reveal decision-maker contacts for every buyer organization. One-click access to emails, LinkedIn profiles, and direct dial numbers. No more guessing who to pitch."

**TabsCarousel.astro:**
- Web component pattern using `class TabbedCarousel extends HTMLElement`
- Desktop: 3 numbered tabs (01, 02, 03) with underline progress bar animation
- Tab click switches active panel, updates underline via CSS transform
- Mobile: CSS scroll-snap horizontal carousel (overflow-x: scroll, scroll-snap-type: x mandatory)
- Mobile scroll updates active tab indicator via IntersectionObserver or scroll event listener
- Scoped event listeners using `this.querySelector()` (not `document.querySelector()`) to avoid conflicts with multiple instances
- CSS: active tab has lime accent underline, inactive tabs are text-text-secondary
- Use `<slot name="panel-0">`, `<slot name="panel-1">`, `<slot name="panel-2">` pattern for content projection

**Illustration components (CSS-only animations):**
1. **ContractDiscoveryIllustration.astro** - Animated bar chart with 4 bars rising from bottom, staggered animation delays, lime accent gradient fill
2. **SignalScannerIllustration.astro** - Concentric pulse rings (3 rings expanding from center, opacity fade-out, infinite loop)
3. **BuyerIntelIllustration.astro** - Network nodes animation (3-4 connected dots with connecting lines, pulse effect on nodes)

All illustrations use CSS keyframes only, no JavaScript. Dimensions: ~200px x 200px. Use lime accent (#E5FF00) as primary color.

**Mobile responsiveness:**
- Tabs hidden below md breakpoint, carousel visible
- Carousel track: display flex, gap 1rem, each panel flex: 0 0 100%
- Hide scrollbar (scrollbar-width: none, -webkit-scrollbar display none)
- Add -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch for iOS smooth scroll

Build succeeds: `npm run build` from landing/ directory
No TypeScript or Astro errors
Check dist/index.html contains TabsCarousel custom element definition
Verify carousel DOM structure includes data-tab and data-panel attributes
Check CSS keyframes defined for illustrations (pulse, riseUp, etc.)
  </verify>
  <done>
Features section renders with 3 feature cards
Desktop shows numbered tabs that switch panels on click
Mobile shows horizontal scrollable carousel
CSS illustrations animate correctly (bars rise, pulses expand)
All text content is benefit-focused and matches feature copy above

  <action>
Create two sections explaining the user journey and establishing credibility.

**HowItWorksSection.astro:**
- Full-width section with bg-bg-secondary background (alternating from Features)
- Container: max-w-[80rem] px-6 py-24
- Section heading: "How It Works" with subtitle
- 3-step horizontal flow layout on desktop (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8)
- Each step card includes:
  - Step number (large lime accent "01", "02", "03")
  - Step title (h3, font-heading)
  - Step description (p, text-text-secondary)
- Arrow separators between steps on desktop (CSS ::after pseudo-element, hidden on mobile)

**Step content:**
1. **01 - Sign Up Free** - "Create your account in 60 seconds. Upload your company profile or connect your LinkedIn. Get 10 free credits to start."
2. **02 - Search & Filter** - "Browse 200,000+ UK government contracts. Filter by sector, value, region. Let AI score opportunities based on your company fit."
3. **03 - Reveal & Win** - "Spend 1 credit to reveal buyer contact details. Reach decision-makers directly. Win more contracts with less guesswork."

**SocialProofSection.astro:**
- Full-width section with bg-bg-primary background
- Container: max-w-[80rem] px-6 py-16
- Two-column layout on desktop (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12)
- Left column: Market statistics (2-3 stats with large numbers in lime accent)
  - "£434B" - UK Public Sector Procurement (annual)
  - "200,000+" - Active Contract Opportunities

- 6 signal categories per RESEARCH.md signal type taxonomy
