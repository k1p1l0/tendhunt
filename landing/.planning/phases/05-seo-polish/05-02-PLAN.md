<objective>
Audit and fix responsive design across all breakpoints (375px mobile, 768px tablet, 1024px laptop, 1280px+ desktop), then verify Lighthouse Performance score 95+.

Purpose: Satisfy LAND-19 (responsive QA) and LAND-18 (Lighthouse 95+) so the landing page works flawlessly on all devices and scores well in performance audits.
Output: All section components responsive, no overflow issues, verified passing Lighthouse.

Build the site (`cd landing && npm run build`) and examine the built HTML output to identify responsive issues. Then systematically audit each component:

**Known responsive concerns to check and fix:**

1. **Hero section (index.astro):**
   - On small mobile (375px), the hero text "The only platform built for UK public sector sales" may overflow. Ensure `text-4xl` on mobile is readable without overflow.
   - The stats bar at the bottom ("Free to start", "No credit card required", "10 free credits") -- third item is `hidden sm:flex` which is correct. Verify the first two don't wrap awkwardly.
   - The two CTA buttons use `flex-col sm:flex-row` which is correct for stacking on mobile.

2. **Features section (FeaturesSection.astro + TabsCarousel.astro):**
   - Tab buttons: ensure they don't overflow horizontally on mobile (375px). If 3 tab labels are too wide, they should wrap or scroll. Add `overflow-x-auto` to the tabs container if needed, or make tabs stack vertically on mobile.
   - Feature panels use `flex-col` on mobile, `flex-row` on md+. The illustration is 200x200 fixed -- ensure it doesn't cause overflow on 375px (200px + 48px padding = 248px, fits in 375px minus 48px margins = 327px, OK).

3. **How It Works section:**
   - Uses 5-column grid on md+ (step, arrow, step, arrow, step). On mobile it's 1-column. Verify the arrows are hidden on mobile (`.hiw-arrow { display: none; }` below md). This looks correct.
   - Verify `.hiw-step__desc` max-width: 320px with `margin: 0 auto` on mobile centers properly.

4. **Social Proof section:**
   - 2-column grid on md+, 1-column on mobile. Check that the large stat values (`font-size: 2.5rem` mobile / `3.25rem` desktop) don't overflow.
   - Trust badge cards: ensure padding and text fit within 375px minus 48px margins.

5. **Pricing section:**
   - `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` -- correct. Verify PricingCard component doesn't have fixed widths that cause issues.

6. **FAQ section:**
   - Summary text + icon layout. Ensure long question text wraps properly and doesn't overlap the +/x icon. The `pr-4` on h3 and `flex-shrink-0` on icon should handle this.

7. **Waitlist section:**
   - Form is `max-w-md mx-auto` (448px max) -- fits in all breakpoints.
   - Turnstile widget may have its own width. Add `max-width: 100%` to `.cf-turnstile` container if needed.

8. **Header:**
   - Mobile hamburger shows below lg (1024px). Verify the dropdown menu doesn't overflow.
   - Check that the Button CTA in mobile menu is accessible.

9. **Footer:**
   - 4-column grid uses `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4`. On mobile (375px) the 2-column layout should work but verify the oversized tagline text (`text-5xl` mobile) doesn't overflow. If "Find contracts. Win business." at 5xl is too wide for 375px, consider reducing to `text-4xl` on smallest screens.
   - Add `overflow-hidden` or `overflow-wrap: break-word` to the footer tagline container as safety.

10. **Global overflow prevention (global.css):**
    - Add `overflow-x: hidden` to `body` in global.css to prevent any accidental horizontal scroll caused by the hero animations or SVG map:
    ```css
    body {
      overflow-x: hidden;
    }
    ```

**For each issue found:** Make the minimal CSS/class change needed. Do not restructure components -- only adjust responsive classes and breakpoints.

**Performance micro-optimizations while editing:**
- Verify that `will-change: transform, opacity` on particles in HeroBackground.astro is scoped and doesn't cause excessive layer promotion. If there are more than ~8 elements with `will-change`, consider removing it from some.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `cd landing && npm run build` -- zero errors. Manually check the built HTML in dist/ for overflow concerns. Verify body has overflow-x: hidden in the CSS output. Verify footer tagline has appropriate text sizing for mobile.
  </verify>
  <done>
All sections have been audited for responsive issues at 375px, 768px, and 1280px. Any overflow or layout issues are fixed. Body has overflow-x: hidden as safety net. Footer tagline text scales appropriately for mobile.

  <what-built>
    Complete SEO and responsive implementation across the TendHunt landing page (across Plan 01 and Plan 02):
    1. Full SEO meta tags (OG, Twitter cards, canonical URLs) on all pages
    2. JSON-LD structured data (WebSite, Organization, FAQPage)
    3. OG image for social sharing
    4. Font preloading for performance
    5. Responsive design fixes across all breakpoints
    6. Performance optimizations (overflow-x hidden, theme-color)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the dev server: `cd landing && npm run dev`
    2. **Desktop check (1280px+):** Open http://localhost:4321 in Chrome. All sections should display correctly with proper spacing.
    3. **Mobile check (375px):** Open Chrome DevTools (F12) -> Toggle Device Toolbar -> Select "iPhone SE" (375px). Scroll through the entire page:
       - Hero text is readable, doesn't overflow
       - Feature tabs don't overflow horizontally
       - Pricing cards stack vertically
       - FAQ accordions open/close properly
       - No horizontal scrollbar anywhere
    4. **Tablet check (768px):** Switch to "iPad Mini" in DevTools. Verify two-column layouts display correctly.
    5. **SEO check:** View page source (Ctrl+U). Verify:
       - `<meta property="og:description"` exists
       - `<meta property="og:url"` exists
       - `<meta name="twitter:card"` exists
       - `<link rel="canonical"` exists
       - Two `application/ld+json` scripts on home page (WebSite + Organization)
       - FAQPage schema in FAQ section area
    6. **Lighthouse:** Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools -> Lighthouse tab -> Check "Performance" -> Run on both Mobile and Desktop. Target: 95+ Performance.
    7. **Structured Data:** Copy the FAQPage JSON-LD from page source and paste into https://search.google.com/test/rich-results to verify it passes.
