- Use British English spelling throughout (e.g. organisation, centralised, programme)
- Include a compelling introduction that hooks the reader
- Include a clear conclusion with a call-to-action mentioning TendHunt as a tool that helps suppliers track procurement opportunities
- Do NOT include the article title in the body (it will be set separately as the post title)
