<objective>
Verify the complete Sculptor AI homepage and floating assistant experience visually and functionally.

Purpose: Phase 30 is primarily a visual/UX transformation. Automated tests can verify code compiles, but the animated icon, layout proportions, dark mode rendering, bubble positioning, and panel handoff all need human visual confirmation.

Output: User confirmation or issue list for gap closure.

    Human visual verification of the complete Sculptor AI experience. Start the dev server and walk through the 24-point checklist covering: dashboard homepage hero layout, floating bubble on other pages, Sculptor branding, dark mode, and accessibility.

    Start the dev server (`bun dev` in apps/web) and verify:

    **Dashboard Homepage (http://localhost:3000/dashboard):**
    1. Animated starburst icon (sculptor.png) is visible and slowly rotating
    2. "Welcome back, {your name}" greeting displays below the icon
    3. "What would you like to explore?" subtitle appears
    4. Large hero chat input is centered and prominent (rounded-2xl border)
    5. 4 suggestion chips appear below the input
    6. Clicking a suggestion chip opens the right-side Sheet panel AND sends the message
    7. Typing in hero input and pressing Enter opens panel AND sends message
    8. "Jump back in" section shows recent conversations (if any exist in DB)
    9. Existing content (scanners, signals, account manager) appears below
    10. No floating bubble visible on this page

    **Non-Dashboard Pages (e.g., /scanners, /buyers, /contracts):**
    11. Floating bubble appears in bottom-right corner (56px circle with starburst icon)
    12. Bubble has subtle pulse/breathing animation
    13. Clicking bubble opens the AgentPanel Sheet
    14. Bubble disappears when panel is open
    15. Bubble reappears with scale animation when panel closes
    16. Bubble is NOT visible on /dashboard

    **Branding:**
    17. Header button says "Sculptor" (not "Chat with AI")
    18. Sidebar item says "Sculptor" (not "Research")
    19. Panel header says "Sculptor" (not "Research Agent")
    20. Starburst icon appears in header button and panel header (not colored orb)

    **Dark Mode:**
    21. Toggle dark mode -- starburst icon inverts to white
    22. All components remain readable in dark mode

    **Accessibility:**
    23. Enable "Reduce motion" in OS settings -- starburst stops rotating, bubble appears without scale animation
    24. All buttons have visible focus rings when tabbed to
