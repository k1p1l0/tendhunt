## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: MongoDB Atlas replaces PostgreSQL/Drizzle/Neon (flexibility, free tier)
- [Roadmap]: No LinkedIn scraping -- contacts from public sources only (GOV.UK, council pages, NHS boards)
- [Roadmap]: Vibe Scanner (Claude Haiku AI scoring) is the core differentiator
- [Roadmap]: G-Cloud dropped -- only Find a Tender and Contracts Finder APIs
- [Roadmap]: Data-first build order (data in DB before UI)
- [01-01]: ClerkProvider dynamic mode for build compatibility with placeholder keys
- [01-01]: proxy.ts at src/proxy.ts (inside src-dir) for Next.js 16
- [01-01]: Zod 4 for env validation (newer API, auto-installed)
- [01-02]: Mongoose 9.x connect() is a no-op when already connected -- no global caching needed
- [01-02]: All models use mongoose.models.X || mongoose.model() for hot-reload safety
- [01-02]: verifyWebhook from @clerk/nextjs/webhooks (not svix) for webhook verification
- [01-02]: Dashboard layout uses await auth() as required by Next.js 16
- [Infra]: Cloudflare infrastructure (Pages, Workers, R2) -- replaces AWS
- [Infra]: tendhunt.com = landing page, app.tendhunt.com = authenticated app (domain split)
- [02-01]: FaT API uses links.next full URLs for pagination (not bare cursor tokens)
- [02-01]: FaT API rejects comma-separated stages -- fetch each stage separately
- [02-01]: 60-day window with dual-stage fetch to ensure 200+ contracts
- [02-01]: Relative imports in scripts (../../src/) since tsx runs outside Next.js
- [02-02]: CF OCDS search API supports comma-separated stages (unlike FaT)
- [02-02]: CF uses publishedFrom/publishedTo date params (not updatedFrom/updatedTo)
- [02-02]: Per-release error handling for resilient batch mapping
- [02-03]: Signal upsert uses compound key {organizationName, signalType, title} for deduplication
- [02-03]: Buyer upsert uses {orgId} as unique identifier
- [02-03]: Static contractCount values for hackathon demo (real counts derivable post-ingestion)
- [02-03]: No LinkedIn data in contacts per project constraint -- empty string placeholder
- [03-01]: Presigned URL uploads to R2 -- server never handles file bytes, only generates signed URLs
- [03-01]: XHR for upload progress tracking -- fetch API lacks upload progress events
- [03-01]: Onboarding gate via Clerk middleware sessionClaims.metadata.onboardingComplete
- [03-01]: Steps 2-3 of wizard are placeholder shells -- Plan 02 implements AI generation and profile review
- [03-01]: Raw JSON schema over zodOutputFormat for Anthropic structured output -- avoids Zod 4 compatibility issues
