## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: MongoDB Atlas replaces PostgreSQL/Drizzle/Neon (flexibility, free tier)
- [Roadmap]: No LinkedIn scraping -- contacts from public sources only (GOV.UK, council pages, NHS boards)
- [Roadmap]: Vibe Scanner (Claude Haiku AI scoring) is the core differentiator
- [Roadmap]: G-Cloud dropped -- only Find a Tender and Contracts Finder APIs
- [Roadmap]: Data-first build order (data in DB before UI)
- [01-01]: ClerkProvider dynamic mode for build compatibility with placeholder keys
- [01-01]: proxy.ts at src/proxy.ts (inside src-dir) for Next.js 16
- [01-01]: Zod 4 for env validation (newer API, auto-installed)
- [01-02]: Mongoose 9.x connect() is a no-op when already connected -- no global caching needed
- [01-02]: All models use mongoose.models.X || mongoose.model() for hot-reload safety
- [01-02]: verifyWebhook from @clerk/nextjs/webhooks (not svix) for webhook verification
- [01-02]: Dashboard layout uses await auth() as required by Next.js 16
